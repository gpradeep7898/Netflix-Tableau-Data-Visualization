# Advanced Netflix Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains the Tableau and RapidMiner project files for an advanced data analysis and visualization project centered around Netflix's extensive catalog. The project aims to explore and visualize various aspects of the Netflix dataset, including content distribution by regions, content types, release years, ratings, and genres. In addition, it incorporates machine learning techniques for predictive analytics and pattern discovery.

## Project Description

This project is an in-depth study of Netflix's global content distribution and viewer preferences, integrating data visualization with machine learning. Using Tableau for data visualization and RapidMiner for machine learning, the project aims to deliver insightful, interactive, and predictive analytics in a user-friendly manner.

## Data Visualization Dashboards

The Tableau workbook contains the following dashboards:

1. **Global Content Distribution**: A visual representation of the distribution of Netflix content across different regions of the world.
2. **Content Type Analysis**: A breakdown of Netflix's content by type (Movies, TV Shows) and their respective ratings.
3. **Yearly Content Release**: A representation of the number of content releases on Netflix over the years, showing Netflix's catalog growth over time.
4. **Genre Analysis**: An overview of Netflix content by genre.

## Machine Learning Models

Using RapidMiner, several machine learning models were created to analyze patterns in the dataset and make predictions:

1. **Random Forest Model**: This model was used to predict the popularity of a show or movie based on features such as type, director, and cast.
2. **Decision Tree Model**: This model was used to identify the key factors that influence the ratings of shows and movies.
3. **Regression Techniques**: Regression models were used to predict continuous outcomes, such as predicting the length of a movie based on its genre and director.

Each model underwent cross-validation to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
